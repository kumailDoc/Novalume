# NOVALUME - NIGHT SKY FROM AN EXOPLANET

# ABOUT

There are over 5500 confirmed and over 10,000 candidate exoplanets according to NASA. This application imagines the night sky from four of the confirmed exoplanets: Kepler-186f, Kepler-452b, Proxima Centauri b and CoRot-7b.

# USAGE

There are three (3) different complexity levels: beginner, intermediate and advanced. The higher the complexity, the more data is shown to the user.

Different exoplanets will have different host stars and in some cases multiple host stars with varying properties. These will affect the amount of stars that are seen from the exoplanet.
