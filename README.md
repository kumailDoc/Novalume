# NOVALUME - NIGHT SKY FROM AN EXOPLANET


## ABOUT

There are over 5500 confirmed and thousands more candidate exoplanets according to NASA. The sky will look different from each exoplanet as the view will depend on the properties of its host star(s).This application imagines the night sky from four of the confirmed exoplanets: Kepler-186f, Kepler-452b, Proxima Centauri b and CoRot-7b. The app has three (3) complexity levels: beginner, intermediate and advanced. The higher the complexity level, the more data is shown to the user.
